    <h1>The Golden Egg</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid a golden egg every day. The egg provided enough money 
        for the farmer and his wife for their day-to-day needs. The farmer and his wife were happy for a long time. 
        But one day, the farmer got an idea and thought, “Why should I take just one egg a day? Why can’t I take all of them at once and
        make a lot of money?”.The foolish farmer’s wife also agreed and decided to cut the goose’s stomach for the eggs. As soon as they killed
        the bird and opened the goose’s stomach, to find nothing but guts and blood. The farmer, realizing his foolish mistake, cries over
        the lost resource!</p>
